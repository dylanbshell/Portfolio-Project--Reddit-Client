This is a Reddit-style news reader application built with React and Redux for a coding bootcamp project.

## Technology Stack
- React 18
- Redux Toolkit
- Jest & React Testing Library for testing
- Reddit API for data

- Follow Redux Toolkit patterns
- Do not use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Write tests for all components

### Key Requirements
- Mobile responsive design

- Detailed post view (modal or route)
- Users can read posts and comments
- Users can not login to an account, comment, or vote
- 90+ Lighthouse score
- Unit and E2E tests

### When Making Changes
- Always run tests before committing
- Follow component naming conventions (PascalCase)
- Add PropTypes for all props
- Update tests when adding features

### Common Tasks
- `npm start` - development server
- `npm test` - run tests
- `npm run build` - production build
- `npm run lighthouse` - performance testing

## Specific Instructions
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)

- Use local state for UI-only state (modals, forms)
- Follow accessibility best practices
- Prioritize performance (lazy loading, memoization)
